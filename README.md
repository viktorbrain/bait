Area of Interest Tracking Techniques for Naturalistic Driving Scenarios Focusing on Visual Distraction Detection

Recent advancements in eye-tarcking technology have greatly improved the understanding of driver behaviour and distraction, especially in naturalistic driving scenarios where there are many diverse environmental variables. Although traditional methods can provide valuable insights, they may not fully address the complexities of real-world driving due to reliability issues, and the inability to adapt to the three-dimensional nature of a driver's Field of View (FOV). This gap in the literature underscores a pressing need for innovative solutions capable of overcoming these aggravating factors. Specif-ically, there exists a critical demand for methodologies that can accurately define and detect AOIs within the cabin space of passenger vehicles—where the windshield's tilt and dashboard architecture introduce unique spatial considerations. Conventional flat-surface marker-based identification systems do not suffice due to potential ob-structions, such as the steering wheel or the driver's hands, and external factors like changing light conditions and glare, which compromise detection efficiency. To address these challenges, our study presents a novel approach that utilises a mathematical model implemented in Matlab. This model is designed to detect markers with excep-tional efficiency, accurately identifying complex areas of interest (AOIs) within the driver's operational environment. Our method stands out due to its ability to consider the spatial dynamics of in-vehicle interfaces and the external environmental factors that affect visibility and detection accuracy.
